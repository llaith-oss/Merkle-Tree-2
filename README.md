# Merkle-Tree

- Implemented a Java application in IntelliJ to build a Merkle tree from a text file

- Read a UTF-8 file of text lines, stored each line in a node on a list, and created a second list of cryptographic hashes of these nodes

- Developed a SHA-256 hash function to compute the cryptographic hashes of the nodes

- Prompted the user for a file name, read the file, built the Merkle tree, and displayed the Merkle root
